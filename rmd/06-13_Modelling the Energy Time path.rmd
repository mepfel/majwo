## Updates
- ARIMA Model in the multivariate framework did not work!

-> Forecasted time path is not realistic

-> Model Change is required!

    - Dummies instead of Differencing (working_day, month)
  

Based on the paper: Day-ahead electricity price forecasting with high-dimensional structures: Univariate vs. multivariate modeling frameworks

-> AR-Model

-> VAR-Model
